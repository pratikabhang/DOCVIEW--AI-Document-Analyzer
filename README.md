# **DOCVIEW: AI Document Analyzer**

Welcome to **DocView**! This is a full-stack **(MERN-Stack)** application that integrates an AI-powered document processing backend with a React-based frontend. The app allows users to upload documents for summarization, generate key insights, and chat with an AI based on the document's content.

<h2 id="-overview">üìñ Overview</h2>

The **DocView** app is designed to provide users with a simple, AI-powered document management tool. Users can upload PDFs or Word documents and receive summaries, key insights, and discussion points. Additionally, users can chat with an AI using the document's content for further clarification.

**DocView** is created using the **MERN-Stack** architecture, which stands for **Firebase, Express, React, and Node.js**. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, integrating Firebase for user authentication and MongoDB for data storage. The frontend is built with React and Material-UI, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

- **Frontend**: Deployed on **Vercel**. Access the live frontend **[here](https://DocView.vercel.app/)**.
  - **Backup Frontend**: We have a backup of the frontend on **Netlify**. You can access the backup app **[here](https://DocView-ai-app.netlify.app/)**.
- **Backend**: Deployed on **Vercel**. You can access the live backend **[here](https://DocView-app-backend-api.vercel.app/)**.
  - **Backup Backend API**: Deployed on **Render**. You can access the backup backend **[here](https://DocView-ai-app.onrender.com/)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The backend server may take a few seconds to wake up if it has been inactive for a while. The first API call may take a bit longer to respond. Subsequent calls should be faster as the server warms up.

> [!NOTE]
> Additionally, the Render-deployed backend is currently on the **Free Tier** of **Render**, so it may take longer to process your request since we are only allocated **512MB and 0.1 CPU**.

<h2 id="getting-started">üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started</h2>

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (between v14 and v20)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Firebase Admin SDK** credentials
- **Redis** for caching
- **MongoDB** for data storage
- **RabbitMQ** for handling asynchronous tasks
- **Docker** for containerization (optional)
- **Postman** for API testing (optional)
- **Expo CLI** for running the mobile app
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD (optional)
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration (optional)
- **React Native CLI** for building the mobile app
- **Firebase SDK** for mobile app integration
- **Firebase API Keys and Secrets** for authentication
- **Expo Go** app for testing the mobile app on a physical device
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the frontend
- **.env** file with necessary API keys (You can contact me to get the `.env` file - but you should obtain your own API keys for production).

Additionally, **basic fullstack development knowledge and AI/ML concepts** are recommended to understand the app's architecture and functionalities.

### **Frontend Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/DocView-AI-App.git
   cd DocView-AI-App/backend
   ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if you face any peer dependency issues.

4. **Start the Frontend React app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Build the Frontend React app (for production)**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Alternatively, you can use `yarn` to install dependencies and run the app**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```
7. **Or, for your convenience, if you have already installed the dependencies, you can directly run the app in the root directory using**:

   ```bash
   npm run frontend
   ```

   This way, you don't have to navigate to the `frontend` directory every time you want to run the app.

8. **The app's frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`**. You can now access it in your browser.

### **Backend Installation**

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this is optional since we are deploying the backend on **Render**. However, you can (and should) run the backend locally for development purposes.

1. **Navigate to the root (not `backend`) directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if you face any peer dependency issues.

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   
4. **The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`**. You can access the API endpoints in your browser or **Postman**.
5. **Additionally, the backend code is in the `backend` directory**. Feel free to explore the API endpoints and controllers.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Note:** Be sure to use Node v.20 or earlier to avoid compatibility issues with Firebase Admin SDK.

### **Running the Mobile App**

1. **Navigate to the mobile app directory**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Expo server**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. **Run the app on an emulator or physical device**: Follow the instructions in the terminal to run the app on an emulator or physical device.

<h2 id="deployment">üöß Deployment</h2>

### **Frontend Deployment (Vercel)**

1. **Install the Vercel CLI**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy the frontend**:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions in your terminal to complete the deployment**.

### **Backend Deployment (Render)**

- The backend can be deployed on platforms like **Heroku**, **Render**, or **Vercel**.

- Currently, we are using **Render** to host the backend. You can access the live backend **[here](https://DocView-ai-app.onrender.com/)**.

### **Important Note about Backend Deployment**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Please note that we are currently on the **Free Tier** of **Render**. This means that the backend server may take a few seconds to wake up if it has been inactive for a while.
>
> - Therefore, the first API call may take a bit longer to respond. Subsequent calls should be faster as the server warms up. It is completely normal to take up to 2 minutes for the first API call to respond.
>
> - Also, the **Free Tier** of **Render** only allocates **512MB and 0.1 CPU**. This may result in slower response times for API calls and document processing.
>
> - Additionally, during high traffic periods, the server may take longer to respond, although we have employed [NGINX](#load-balancing) for load balancing and caching.
